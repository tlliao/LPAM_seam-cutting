## Seam-guided-local-alignment

This repository is our implementation of the paper, Seam-guided Local Alignment and Stitching for Large Parallax Images. If you use any code or data from our work, please cite our paper.

### Usage

1. Download code, add images in the folder "Imgs" in the main path and run the "main.m".

2. This code has been tested on 64bit Windows; for other platforms, you'll need to compile your own mex files in _maxflow-v3.03.src_ and _SIFTflow_.
